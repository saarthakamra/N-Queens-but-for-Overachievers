# N Queens, but for Overachievers

So, you've mastered chess on a flat, boring plane. Cute. But are you ready to graduate from 2D and conquer the third dimension?

Welcome to the classic N-Queens puzzle, cranked up to eleven and thrown into a glowing, minimalist cube. This isn't your grandpa's chess club. This is a challenge for your brain's brain.

## Why is this the Best Way to Procrastinate?

- **An Endless Challenge:** Go from a humble 1x1x1 cube to brain-melting, coffee-spilling behemoths. The game literally never ends. Good luck.

- **Enter the Void:** A sleek, dark theme with glowing, ethereal pieces. It's just you and the cube, floating in a stylish, infinite black room. Very dramatic.

- **Claim Your Glory:** The game saves your high scores for every level size. Go back and prove to your past self that you're even smarter now.

- **The Sandbox of the Gods:** Feeling creative? Press 'C' to enter a world without rules. Build beautiful, impossible queen constellations. Make art. I won't judge.

- **Controls That Just Work:** Rotate with your mouse, slice with the arrow keys. It's all relative to how you're looking at the cube, because it's fancy like that.

## How to Ascend to the Third Dimension

1. **Grab the Files:** Download `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
